# 188-288 Final Project

This repository contains the code and data for the final project. The analysis is implemented as a Python script that reads the required input datasets from the `data/` directory, executes the full workflow, and saves all generated outputs (including plots, variable lists and function returns) to the `output/` directory. A `requirements.txt` file is provided to ensure reproducibility.

To run the project, first install the required dependencies using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Once the dependencies are installed, run the main script with:

python 188_FINAL_PROJECT.py

After execution, all results and figures produced will be available in the `output/` directory.
